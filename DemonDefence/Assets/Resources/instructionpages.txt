1. You will have three DETACHMENTS, each consisting of four squads and one Sergeant. DETACHMENTS are denoted by coloured diamonds at their feet.
- 2. The enemy will also have three DETACHMENTS, consisting of three squads and one Greater Demon. Demons are individually stronger than soldiers.
- 3. When you select a unit, a number of tiles will be highlighted. If a tile is GREEN, you can move your unit to that tile; click on the tile to do so. If a tile is CYAN, your unit can give a buff to that unit (see page 6). 
You will be automatically advanced through your units, but you can click on other units in your army to instead select that unit. 
Units can make up to two movements per turn.
- 4. If a tile is ORANGE, you can make an attack. The RED number above the target denotes what ROLL RESULT is required. To attack, click on that unit. If a unit makes an attack, they are unable to take any more actions.
For all units, attacks can be made when they are on a tile ADJACENT to a hostile unit.
- 5. A number of ROLLS will be made, with their results being shown in a set of ROLL CARDS. One ROLL is made for each individual in the unit. As damage is taken, individuals will die, limiting that unit's rolls.
- 6. Your Sergeants have access to three ORDERS. Each Sergeant can give their detachment one ORDER per turn. This does not reduce your actions. The orders are as follows
Advance: Increase the movement of affected units by 2
Strike: Reduce the attack threshold against enemy units by 2
Defend: Increase the attack threshold against affected units by 2
- 7. The game ends when one team has been fully destroyed. When the game ends, the game will automatically close after a few seconds.
If you find any bugs, please send them to me on Discord! This is a very early development version and will certainly have issues.

Kite pathfinding may be a bit interesting: they are set up so that, if they detect a city wall between them and the nearest target, they will navigate to one of the gates (based on distance from them to the gate and from the gate to the target) until they are no longer blocked by a city wall.
