1. You will have a number of DETACHMENTS, each consisting of 4 squads and one Sergeant. DETACHMENTS are denoted by coloured diamonds at their feet.
- 2. The enemy will also have a number of DETACHMENTS, consisting of three squads and one Greater Demon / Kite Alpha, depending on detachment.
- 3. When you select a unit, a number of tiles will be highlighted. If a tile is GREEN, you can move your unit to that tile; click on the tile to do so. If a tile is CYAN, your unit can give a buff to that unit (see page 6). 
You will be automatically advanced through your units, but you can click on other units in your army to instead select that unit, or press 'TAB' to cycle to the next unit
Units can make up to two movements per turn.
- 4. If a tile is ORANGE, you can make an attack. The RED number above the target denotes what ROLL RESULT is required. To attack, click on that unit. If a unit makes an attack, they are unable to take any more actions.

Each unit has a minimum range and a maximum range. If an enemy is within the minimum range, or outside the maximum range, they cannot be targeted. They also cannot be targeted if they cannot be seen.
- 5. A number of ROLLS will be made, with their results being shown in a set of ROLL CARDS. One ROLL is made for each individual in the unit. As damage is taken, individuals will die, limiting that unit's rolls.
- 6. Detachment LEADERS have access to various abilities, which can be found on the Detachment page beneath each Detachment's LEADER card. Abilities can improve unit performance or trade one ability for another.
- 7. The game ends when one team has been fully destroyed. When the game ends, the game will automatically close after a few seconds.
If you find any bugs, please send them to me on Discord! This is a very early development version and will certainly have issues.

Kite pathfinding may be a bit interesting: they are set up so that, if they detect a city wall between them and the nearest target, they will navigate to one of the gates (based on distance from them to the gate and from the gate to the target) until they are no longer blocked by a city wall.
