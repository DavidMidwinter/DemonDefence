1. You will have a number of DETACHMENTS, each consisting of 3 to 4 Troops and one Leader. DETACHMENTS are denoted by coloured diamonds at their feet.
- 2. The enemy will also have a number of DETACHMENTS, consisting of 3 to 4 Troops and one Leader.
- 3. When you select a unit, a number of tiles will be highlighted. If a tile is GREEN, you can move your unit to that tile; click on the tile to do so. If a tile is CYAN, your unit can give a buff to that unit (see page 6). 
You will be automatically advanced through your units, but you can click on other units in your army to instead select that unit, or press 'TAB' to cycle to the next unit
Units can make up to two movements per turn.
- 4. If a tile is ORANGE, you can make an attack. The RED number above the target denotes what ROLL RESULT is required. To attack, click on that unit. If a unit makes an attack, they are unable to take any more actions (unless stated otherwise).
The required ROLL RESULT is equal to 6, plus the difference between the target toughness and the attacker strength. For instance, a unit of strength 5 attacking a unit of toughness 7 will have to make a roll of 5 + 2, resulting in a 7+ roll required. A roll of 10 will always PASS, a roll of 1 will always FAIL.

If a unit has STRENGTH AGAINST a unit type, their Strength is doubled for attacks against that type. If a unit has WEAKNESS AGAINST a unit type, their Strength is instead halved.

Each unit has a minimum range and a maximum range. If an enemy is within the minimum range, or outside the maximum range, they cannot be targeted. They also cannot be targeted if they cannot be seen.

- 5. A number of ROLLS will be made, with their results being shown in a set of ROLL CARDS. The number of attacks a unit makes is shown on their Unit Card on the Unit Stats page, as 'Individual Attacks / Total Attacks'. Individual attacks is how many attack rolls a single individual will make; Total Attacks is the total number of attacks taken by the unit when at full size. As damage is taken, individuals will die, limiting that unit's rolls. Most units will take 1 attack per individual.

Unit health can be found on the DETACHMENTS page, as 'Individual Health / Total Health'. Individual health is how much health can be lost before a unit individual is removed. Total health is how much health can be taken before the unit is removed.

Successful HIT ROLLS will be GREEN, while failed HIT ROLLS will be RED.
- 6. Detachment LEADERS have access to various abilities, which can be found on the Unit Stats page in each Detachment's LEADER card. Abilities can improve unit performance or trade one ability for another. Most Player Leader Units will have a selection of Orders, while most Demon Leader Units will have either passive abilities.
- 7. The game ends when one team has been fully destroyed. When the game ends, the game will automatically close after a few seconds.
